# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

User needs are interpretted through initial communications and a constant feedback loop between PO and end users/stakeholders. The thoughts and opinions of the users and stakeholders is some of the most valuable information a business can get their hands on. It’s the deep understanding of demand, expectations, taste and distastes of the user base that will drive a business’s success. Imagine trying to run a business without engaging with your users? It’d be like throwing darts in the dark. 

User stories have a very basic way of breaking down the requirements into a template for the scrum team to then dissect. The standard template for user stories goes something like this: “As a <insert role>, I want to <insert task>, so that I can <insert goal>.” Once the Scrum Team has the user stories defined, they are placed in the Product Backlog. There, they will be prioritized by type of user, size of the story, and story ID. When diving into each story, the Scrum Team sets the Acceptance Criteria to help achieve each value statement. In short, the user stories help the scrum team by creating building blocks and therefore a task list roadmap of how to achieve desired requirements. 
  
Additionally, as user stories are written, the business is slowly creating user history. When in retrospective and going over company metrics, the implementations stories and their acceptance criteria’s can be beneficial information to review.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Well after this course, I believe my approach to developing programs has altered in many ways. Prior to CS250, I had never heard of agile or it's methodologies. I've lived most of my adult and career life using waterfall. Now, after CS250, I'm slowly going to incoprorate agile into my developments and do hybrid tests until I find an approach that yields great results.
  
In the future, more specifically my next class, I'm going to take the entire curriculum and create a "product backlog" of assignments. Then I'll utilize burn-up charts to track progress and completion dates. I may even lean towards having a daily scrum, yes... with myself,and see if it's beneificial. And I will take these methodologies and tools into my next software development as well. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in any field should really touch on all critical attributes such as positive attitude, communication, active listening, problem-solving and flexibility. However, in software development, it is vital to the teams success that each member stay self-disciplined, hold themselves accountable, and communicate at a high level. Every good team member in software development will possess at least those three attributes.
